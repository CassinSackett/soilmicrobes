# soilmicrobes
Script for describing microbial diversity in soils from prairie dog burrows

This repository will contain an R script that calculates the proportion of each microbial taxon as a function of 1) Yersinia presence and 2) region in the burrow. It will also include R scripts for creating taxa barplots and other figures found in the manuscript "Fine-scale spatial structure of soil microbial communities in burrows of a keystone rodent following mass mortality."
