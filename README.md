# soilmicrobes
Script for describing microbial diversity in soils from prairie dog burrows

This repository will contain an R script that performs the following tasks:
1) calculates the proportion of each microbial taxon as a function of Yersinia presence 
2) generates a model to determine the best predictors of Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity, including nutrients and microbial taxa
3) determines whether microbial taxa vary at fine spatial scales within prairie dog burrows

It will also include R scripts for calculating various metrics and creating figures found in the manuscript "Fine-scale spatial structure of soil microbial communities in burrows of a keystone rodent following mass mortality."
